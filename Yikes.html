                        <p>Ok so I met this guy on a dating app. When we finally set up a date he seemed cool at first. He had just gotten home from his mission. Now I like an RM guy as much as anybody, but it seemed like it was the only thing he could talk about. 
                            We got dinner and he insisted that we go to get Kenyan food. He had served his mission in Kenya. Ok. I am usually not a picky eater, but this food was terrible. I could barely get through it. As the dinner progressed I found it harder and harder to focus on making conversation. I was just focused on trying to survive the food.
                        The conversation went on, but I couldn't tell you now what we talked about. "How was the food?" he said as we finished eating. "Oh it was...it was so good," I did my best to say. He seemed super pleased with himself by my response. "I thought you would say that!" So we got in the car and started driving. I felt VERY sick.
                    I thought he was taking me home. I couldn't focus on anything except how bad my stumach was hurting. He kept talking and I did my best to respond. After a few minutes I looked up to my horror and saw that we were driving up the canyon to squaw peak. Oh no. Oh no no no. The winding road started getting steeper and steeper. I held my stumach. He kept talking. I was silent. It took all the focus I had to keep my stumach in my body. 
                Then...something about his tone caught my attention. He said, "Kate...I know this is really sudden but...the Spirit just told me you're the one." I THREW UP. </p>
